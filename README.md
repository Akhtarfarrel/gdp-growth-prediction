This report demonstrates economic forecasting by applying predictive modelling to GDP
growth in percentage terms. Using curated data from the World Bank repository, we
developed and compared multiple models to identify the most reliable approach for predicting GDP growth rates.
Our methodology progressed from a baseline Linear Regression model to more sophisticated techniques. We employed Best Subset Selection to optimize the feature set among
macroeconomic indicators and utilized Generalized Additive Models (GAM) to account
for non-linear dynamics and structural breaks in economic data.
Model performance was evaluated using rigorous statistical thresholds, cross-validation,
and error metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE). The findings indicate that the non-parametric
GAM approach, which captures complex relationships between predictors like investment,
trade, and inflation, provides superior predictive accuracy for GDP growth compared to
conventional linear methods.
